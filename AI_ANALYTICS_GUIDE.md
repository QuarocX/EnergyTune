# AI Analytics Setup Guide

## Overview

EnergyTune's AI Analytics provides advanced pattern recognition and personalized recommendations using machine learning models that run entirely on your device. Your data never leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy.

## Features

### üîç **Pattern Recognition**

- Categorizes your energy and stress sources automatically
- Identifies high-energy activity patterns
- Detects stress escalation triggers
- Recognizes weekly behavioral patterns

### üí° **Smart Recommendations**

- Personalized energy optimization suggestions
- Stress prevention strategies based on your patterns
- Schedule optimization recommendations
- Habit formation insights

### üîó **Advanced Correlation Analysis**

- Sentiment analysis of your text entries
- Language pattern detection for early warning signals
- Multi-dimensional pattern correlation
- Predictive insights based on historical data

## Technical Implementation

### **Model Selection**

- **Primary**: DistilBERT (15MB) for text classification
- **Secondary**: Sentiment analysis model (10MB)
- **Total Size**: ~25MB for complete AI functionality

### **Privacy Architecture**

- **100% Local Processing**: Models run entirely on device
- **No Network Calls**: Zero external API dependencies
- **Secure Storage**: Models cached in app's private directory
- **User Control**: Easy enable/disable with model cleanup

### **Performance Optimization**

- **Lazy Loading**: Models downloaded only when AI is enabled
- **Background Processing**: Analysis runs without blocking UI
- **Smart Caching**: Efficient model storage and reuse
- **Battery Friendly**: Optimized inference for mobile devices

## Integration Points

### **Data Flow**

1. User entries (energy/stress sources) ‚Üí AI Service
2. Text preprocessing and tokenization
3. Model inference for categorization/sentiment
4. Pattern analysis and correlation detection
5. Insight generation and recommendation creation
6. UI display with confidence scores

### **Analytics Enhancement**

- Extends existing `AnalyticsService` without replacement
- Integrates with current `useTrendsData` hook
- Adds new `AIInsightsCard` component
- Maintains compatibility with existing features

## User Experience

### **Progressive Disclosure**

1. **Discovery**: AI card shows when user has some data
2. **Education**: Clear explanation of benefits and privacy
3. **Consent**: Explicit opt-in with model size information
4. **Download**: Progress feedback during model download
5. **Analysis**: Gradual insights as more data is tracked
6. **Value**: Actionable recommendations with confidence scores

### **Fallback Strategy**

- Graceful degradation when AI is disabled
- No breaking changes to existing analytics
- Optional enhancement rather than requirement
- Clear indicators of AI vs. traditional insights

## Best Practices Followed

### **React Native/Expo Compatibility**

- Uses `@xenova/transformers` with React Native support
- Metro configuration for `.mjs` and binary assets
- Expo FileSystem for secure model storage
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android/Web)

### **Performance Standards**

- Sub-200ms UI response times maintained
- Background processing for CPU-intensive tasks
- Smart batching of inference requests
- Memory-efficient model loading

### **User Privacy**

- No telemetry or usage tracking
- Local model storage in app sandbox
- User-controlled data retention
- Transparent about AI processing

### **Error Handling**

- Graceful failure without breaking app
- Clear error messages for users
- Automatic fallback to basic analytics
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Development Guidelines

### **Testing Strategy**

- Unit tests for AI service methods
- Integration tests with mock data
- Performance benchmarking on actual devices
- Privacy audit of data flow

### **Maintenance**

- Model version management
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback integration
- Gradual model improvements

This implementation provides a solid foundation for privacy-first AI analytics that enhances rather than replaces your existing analytics system.
